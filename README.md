# Terminal Configurations

A collection & backup of my personal terminal configurations that I use. For terminal
editing, my primary editor is vim with some styling and plugins. I currently use
`vim-plug` for my plugin management.

## Fonts

I use the [JetBrainsMono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) patched front
from Nerd Fonts. Preview [here](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono).

## .vimrc

My vimrc file is pretty simple, only really changing some styling, setting some
keybindings, and some other QOL settings. See the `.vimrc` file for plugins
and what I changed
