# Terminal Styling

I'm currently using [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev) for terminal styling in both Windows & Ubuntu

# Fonts

I use the [JetBrainsMono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) patched front from Nerd Fonts. Preview [here](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#jetbrainsmono).

# Neo-Vim config

MY NeoVim configuration file was taken directly from the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) repo which has a great starting point. I've fine-tuned it a little since then to include some other plugins and keybindings.
